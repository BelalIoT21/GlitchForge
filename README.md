# GlitchForge

An AI-enhanced vulnerability scanner that uses machine learning to detect and intelligently prioritize security vulnerabilities in web applications and networks.

## Project Overview

GlitchForge combines traditional vulnerability scanning techniques with machine learning algorithms to not only detect security flaws but also intelligently prioritize remediation based on risk assessment.

## Features (Planned)

- Automated vulnerability detection for web applications
- ML-based risk scoring and prioritization
- Support for common vulnerability types (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Integration with CVE/NVD databases
- Detailed vulnerability reports

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (TBD)
- **Security Tools**: Integration with Nmap, Nikto, SQLmap
- **Testing Environment**: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Final Year Project (CN6000) 2025/26

**Current Phase**: Research and initial development

## Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GlitchForge.git
